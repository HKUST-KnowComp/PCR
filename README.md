# PCR
Codes for the survey paper on pronoun coreference resolution
This reporsitory contains code and models adapted from [SpanBERT](https://github.com/younghz/Markdown), [Winogrande](https://github.com/allenai/winogrande), and [GPT2](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2). Additional, we include our analysis and replication code for the regular PCR (CoNLL-2012 solved by SpanBERT) and Hard PCR (Winograd Schema Challenge solved by Winogrande and GPT2) problems. The analysis includes finegrained pronoun setting, cross-domain setting, model comparison, dataset split and etc.

Please refer to the links of the repositories to learn about the setup of each model.
